                <b>Personal Statement</b>
                <p>I have a keen apt for programming and have spent most of my life surround by different pieces of technology, I do anything from fixing up different electronics and also programming within many different languages. I have done coding for so long that I feel as though I am able to find solutions to answers whilst I know when I must seek out support and look for help within my colleges. I have a very out-of-the-box thinking as I am known for finding my own way through a problem to find a solution.</p>
